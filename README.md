## REST API 
I have implemented functionality in my admin page to allow the addition of new items related to
clothes. Each item must include three photographs, two titles for localization
in different languages, two descriptions for localization and timestamps for creation, updating and
deletion. Administrators have the ability to edit, delete, and add these items.
